# Survey-Data

In this repository, we publish the data of the publication "Avoiding Failure in modern Game Design with Academic Content: A Recipe, an Anti-Pattern and Applications thereof", by Kay Berkling, Micha Piertzik and Heiko Faller.

## Survey Results 
This repository contains the website, that shows the results of the survey. It also can be found at http://heiko-faller.de/studienarbeit.
The results are in German, so you may need to use a translation tool to understand

## Participate
If you want to participate, you can still reach the survey. Later we will redefine the survey, to get better data. The surveay is also in German.
